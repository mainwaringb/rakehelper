Description: Quickly and flexibly calculate rake weights (also know as rim weights, 
    or iterative proportional fitting). This allows post-stratification/non-response
    weighting on multiple variables, even the interlocked distribution of the two
    variables is not known. Interacts with Thomas Lumley's "survey" package, 
    and adds additional functionality, more adaptable syntax, and error-checking
    to the weighting functionality in "survey."
